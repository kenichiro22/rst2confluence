.. note:: This is a note.
   This is the second line of the note paragraph.

   This is another paragaph in the note.

.. warning:: This is a warning

.. note:: This is a note

.. tip:: This is a tip


This is the first real standalone paragraph.

All other elements before influence the element_level count,
so having them before the paragraph tests the code quite good.
